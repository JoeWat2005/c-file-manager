# File Management Utility in C

This repository contains my solution to a **C programming assignment** implementing a command-line file management utility using standard C libraries.

## Overview

The assignment focuses on low-level file handling and procedural programming in C. The program provides an interactive menu for performing common file operations, while maintaining a persistent change log.

The implemented functionality includes:

- Creating, copying, deleting, and renaming files
- Displaying file contents and listing directory files
- Appending, inserting, and deleting specific lines in a file
- Counting and displaying the number of lines in a file
- Logging all file operations to a changelog

All functionality is implemented using standard C library functions such as `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and `string.h`.

## Repository Structure

- `main.c` (or equivalent)  
  Main program implementing the file management utility and menu-driven interface.

- `log.txt`  
  Automatically generated changelog recording file operations (created at runtime).

- `README.md`  
  This file.

## Notes

This repository is intended for **educational purposes** and reflects coursework completed as part of a university programming module. The project demonstrates practical use of file I/O, string manipulation, and defensive input handling in C.
